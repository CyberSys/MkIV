DESCRIPTION_START
The DUKW "duck" was based on the GMC 6x6 "deuce and a
half" truck but with a boat-shaped hull. D stands for
1942, U for amphibious, K for all-wheel drive, and W
for twin-rear axles. The DUKW was initially rejected
by the military, until the prototype performed a
daring at-sea resuce of a run-aground Coast Gaurd crew
in heavy surf.
Most vehicles were not armoured, but some special
conversions were made; the rocket-firing Scorpion,
versions with field-guns mounted on the cargo area,
and machine-gun mounting DUKWs.
The DUKW was used by many Allied and Soviet armies in
various theatres, including the D-Day landings in
Normandy. General Eisenhower called the DUKW one of
the most important vehicles of World War II.
