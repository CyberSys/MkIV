DESCRIPTION_START
The Jagdpanther is the heavy tank-destroyer variant of
the Panther tank. It mounts the 88mm PaK43/3 heavy anti-
tank gun of the Koenigstiger. This gun could destroy
any tank at ranges of up to 3km. The first Jagdpanthers
emerged in June 1944. Of the 400 produced, the vehicles
were assigned to heavy anti-tank groups on the Eastern
Front, but were also concentrated for the Ardennes
Offensive, and were available in small numbers to fight
UK troops in Normandy, who the Germans considered a
greater threat than the Americans in that theatre.

The Jagdpanther was well balanced; fast, powerful, and
well armoured. The relatively weak side and rear
armour of the Jagpanther is vulnerable to Allied armour
within 1km range.
