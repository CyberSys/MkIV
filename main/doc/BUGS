=='A' Bugs (Prevent Operation)==

* latest svn co does not include some required ai files - why can't we disable the GA?
* unit handler is not freed after running a scenario. if you load editor after this it keeps old units
* GFS keeps running between launches and crashes on second sim launch
* water doesn't load/save properly

=='B' Bugs (Don't Ruin Flow)==

* time loops around after 60 minutes
* line graphs in fuzzy overlays choke after about an hour of running as too many points are added to line. really need to reset these lines at that point.
* units that start 1000m above group (to fix ships problem) are not properly positioned in memory.
* m4a2 is missing gun pivot bone?
* sometimes attack indicator line turns off - lots of 3d lines problems in fact (maybe replace manual objects with 3D objects of varying colour put above NN)
* water level rises/falls to dramatic levels if the clock skips a few frames; it needs a check to see if it has moved OOB.

=='C' Bugs (Cosmetic)==
* font's not showing on buttons...
* cannon aim only happens after first shot
* cannon aim angle isn't very good
* in editor valleys (RMB) can create even when mouse is over buttons
* shadows darken after first node moved
* widgets are sometimes blocked by lines/other widgets/shadows
* if quit via game score board then debug gui stays on (maybe 'Ok' should just close scores)
* smoke particle effects upset by other transparency (water etc) -> put paged geometry on render queue MAIN

==Hacks==
* Gun animation rotation hack
* Pull out static declarations and temporary gun rotations from animation.
