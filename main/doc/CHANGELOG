Alpha 0.85

	fixed a bug saving scenarios - water plane etc were taken from a widget's sce and not the terrain handler's sce (weird...)

Alpha 0.84 (Skafith): 9 Dec 2009

	basic enemy unit AI (now attacks nearest visible target) not optimised so very slow
	fixed audio freeing bug (was being deleted too early)
	fixed water save/load bug (free() had and "=" in stead of a "==")
	audio can now be properly disabled (no more annoying printouts during runtime)
	some neat printing macros
	audio handler no longer a "globals" member - is now a singleton (so don't have to rebuild entire project if it's modified)
	pre-loading of UI sounds in audio handler
	rebuilt fmod audio handler, cleaned up, removed lots of dodgy scenenode pointers, and stl rubbish
	removed dummy audio handler and old fmod audio handler

	bugfix - extra shrub,building loaded when scenario loaded
	bugfix - extra vehicle loaded at 500,150,0
	bugfix - scenario menu doesn't work until new scenario saved for some reason - maybe related to the shrubs list bug

	bugfix - load shrubs list is empty if #shrubs = exactly one page limit - maths error
	bugfix -  once brush size buttons in editor are hidden once they are not able to be shown again - was due to earlier failing editor components
	tooltip widget in editor now follows mouse cursor
	better unit descriptions and stats for vehicles

	description added to unit browser in editor
	removed timer and replaced with 'stuck counter' - if agents are too slow for too many frames (about 4 seconds worth) then they are 'stuck' and the run is cancelled. they are now adaptive as the whole generation can be cycled in about 8 minutes on one agent - so they can adapt to stuckness in real-time!
	timer added to run logger (and timeout)
