Here are instructions for compilation and installation

Compiling from Source on Windows

1. Download and Install subversion client (e.g. Tortoise SVN)
2. Check out markiv from subversion repository "https://markiv.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/markiv/trunk/main"
3. Download and install MinGW (NOTE: no longer using Ogre's mingw toolkit) from http://www.mingw.org/
4. Set up Windows environment variables for mingw (add 'c:\mingw\bin' to Path)
5. Download and install OGRE SDK for MinGW http://www.ogre3d.org/
6. Download and install FMOD Ex Windows API http://www.fmod.org/
7. Download ETM source http://www.oddbeat.de/wiki/etm
8. Download and install (extract somewhere) RakNet http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/
9. Download and install Eclipse IDE for C++ http://www.eclipse.org/
   Change the C++ compiler to 'mingw32-g++'
   Change the make executable to 'mingw32-make' (if it won't let you don't worry - it's not stricty necessary)
10. Create a new Eclipse project (or you can use another IDE and follow a similar set up)
    The project type should be (you may have to uncheck a box to see all types) "C++ executable" with an automatically managed makefile
    Copy the main 'markiv' directory contents to project folder, excluding 'Release'
    Under 'Project Properties'->'C/C++ Build':
      Under 'Directories' add the following to 'Include paths (-I):
        "...\OgreSDK\include\OIS"
        "...\OgreSDK\include"
        "...\FMOD Programmers API...\api\inc"
      Under 'Libraries' add the following to 'Libraries (-l)':
        "OgreMain"
        "fmodex"
        "OIS"
        "ws2_32"
      Under 'Libraries' add the following to 'Library search path (-L)'
        "...\OgreSDK\bin\release"
        "...\FMODSoundSystem....\api\lib"
11. Copy all the .cpp files from the 'src' folder in the ETM download into markiv/src/scenery (makes it easier to link)
12. Copy the following libraries into the project main directory:
  mingwm10.dll (from mingw install)
  fmodex.dll (from FMOD)
  cg.dll (from Ogre)
  OgreMain.dll (from Ogre)
  OIS.dll (from Ogre)
  Plugin_CgProgramManager.dll (from Ogre)
  Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.dll (from Ogre)
  Plugin_ParticleFX.dll (from Ogre)
  RenderSystem_GL.dll (from Ogre)
  RakNet.dll (from RakNet)
  RakNetDebug.dll (from RakNet)
13. Modify Plugins.cfg
  # Defines plugins to load

  # Define plugin folder
  PluginFolder=.\

  # Define D3D rendering implementation plugin
  Plugin=RenderSystem_GL.dll
  Plugin=Plugin_ParticleFX.dll
  Plugin=Plugin_OctreeSceneManager.dll
  Plugin=Plugin_CgProgramManager.dll

14. Compile and run program from with the IDE
15. Copy 'markiv.exe' from 'markiv\Release' into 'markiv'

Troubleshooting

There are always little problems compiling on Windows.
* Make sure that mingw32-g++ is the compiler being used by the IDE, and not something else
* You may have to fix relative #include paths in some source files (particularly ETM/.h files)
* Make sure that the path to mingwm10.dll is in the library search path (-L)
* I have had some problems with Windows not using the correct ws2_32.dll (Winsock) library
* exclude some of the source files from build (in src/ai/ take out AStar.* and *test.*)
