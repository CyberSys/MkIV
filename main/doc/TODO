* upgrade to new Ogre 1.7 spec
* move content to mkv engine (better audio, graphics etc) -editor programme first, then main programme
* remake GUI as either a MyGUI collection or as a mkv overlay series
* add crew specs to svn (eee)
* NOTE: can cmake-qt-gui a static build of Ogre for a closed-source all-in-one build

= Editor =
* a "water" chooser dialogue with NONE, PLANE, HYDRAX chooser, and height setting option
* make big 3D flags for VL, and add VL to sce file
* add artist, polygons to Top-L of unit browser (for units, shrubs, buildings)
* add crew, max occupants, jeeps somewhere
* add weapon loadout details somewhere (table) - maybe a little graphic bargraph?
* placing VLs
* add a sce details chooser to editor - shields, water type etc (default shields to '1' and '2')
* semi-random start locations (that you specify) for units like in Rebelstar

= Scenery =
* if scenery init below WATER_LINE then do not create as pagedgeo
* Try Hydrax-SkyX - frame rate?
* Try TreeLoader2D
* Get Imposters to work
* fix autoscale not working when using paging scenery
* bridges w/ click on/off

= AI =
== Fuzzy Nav ==
* add collision at 0.0 as 0.0
* remove jittering - is there dumb code somewhere doing this? = yes (set to turn when target straight ahead)
* use 3D distances to obstacles +{fuzzy sets, terrainmgr, vehicle, unithandler}
* building radius should be * scale??

== Other Experiment stuff ==
* "Snail Trail" path recorder (for CSTN-075) with little manual squares/triangles
* leave fuzzy errors and 2D issues in so can show problems with graph (take screenshots) - (for THESIS)

== Scenery ==
* Better nearest neighbour finder? -> wait until it becomes a perf issue
* Grass/bushes
* fiddle with pagesize, batchsize etc for best framerate
* able to switch between water type
* reintroduce semitrans water (no paged geo underwater)

== Units ==
* option to disable GFS - especially in Editor!
* do unit culling as per house and tree culling - with option to set range in ini
* allow units to occupy buildings as with vehicles
* exhaust particles separate from dust - so can have exhaust when on water
* diff fuzzy system for water and land and system has own gfs
* interpolate at distances accuracy
* special effects for hit that doesn't penetrate + "peeeoooww" or "duung"
* units rebalanced near new craters (server, solo)
* explosion sound effects
* KV-2 death turret collapse or tip-over
* remove idle sounds/anims for performance?
