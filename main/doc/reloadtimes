SU-152 was ~2 minutes, which was exceptionally slow.
Tiger was about 30s to reload (abs unrealistic max 1.2 minutes, 
min ~5s), based on this:

The 13.(Tiger) Kompanie, of Panzer Regiment Gro√üdeutschland, reported on 
the armor protection of the Tiger: "During a scouting patrol two Tigers 
encountered about 20 Russian tanks on their front, while additional 
Russian tanks attacked from behind. A battle developed in which the 
armor and weapons of the Tiger were extraordinarily successful. Both 
Tigers were hit (mainly by 76.2 mm armor-piercing shells) 10 or more 
times at ranges from 500 to 1,000 meters. The armor held up all around. 
Not a single round penetrated through the armor. Also hits in the 
running gear, in which the suspension arms were torn away, did not 
immobilize the Tiger. While 76.2 mm anti-tank shells continuously struck 
outside the armor, on the inside, undisturbed, the commander, gunner, 
and loader selected targets, aimed, and fired. The end result was 10 
enemy tanks knocked out by two Tigers within 15 minutes"  (JENTZ, Thomas
